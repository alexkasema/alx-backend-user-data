# Basic authentication
In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: Basic <credentials>, where <credentials> is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon :

# Session Authentication
A session is a small file, most likely in JSON format, that stores information about the user, such as a unique ID, time of login and expirations, and so on. It is generated and stored on the server so that the server can keep track of the user requests. The user receives some of these details, especially the ID, as cookies that will be sent with every new request, so that the server can recognize the ID and authorize the user’s requests.

## Working
- The user sends a login request to the server.
- The server authenticates the login request, sends a session to the database, and returns a cookie containing the session ID to the user.
- Now, the user sends new requests (with a cookie).
- The server checks in the database for the ID found in the cookie, if the ID is found it sends the requested pages to the user.


# Simple API

Simple HTTP API for playing with `User` model.


## Files

### `models/`

- `base.py`: base of all models of the API - handle serialization to file
- `user.py`: user model

### `api/v1`

- `app.py`: entry point of the API
- `views/index.py`: basic endpoints of the API: `/status` and `/stats`
- `views/users.py`: all users endpoints


## Setup

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Run

```
$ API_HOST=0.0.0.0 API_PORT=5000 python3 -m api.v1.app
```


## Routes

- `GET /api/v1/status`: returns the status of the API
- `GET /api/v1/stats`: returns some stats of the API
- `GET /api/v1/users`: returns the list of users
- `GET /api/v1/users/:id`: returns an user based on the ID
- `DELETE /api/v1/users/:id`: deletes an user based on the ID
- `POST /api/v1/users`: creates a new user (JSON parameters: `email`, `password`, `last_name` (optional) and `first_name` (optional))
- `PUT /api/v1/users/:id`: updates an user based on the ID (JSON parameters: `last_name` and `first_name`)
